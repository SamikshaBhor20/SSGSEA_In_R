# SSGSEA_In_R
Interepretation:-

In this manner, ssGSEA transforms a single sample's gene expression profile to a gene set enrichment profile. A gene set's enrichment score represents the activity        level of the biological process in which the gene set's members are coordinately up- or down-regulated.
